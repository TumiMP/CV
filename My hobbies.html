      <h3>Analyzing the financial markets by means of technecial analysis</h3>
    </li>
    This is one of the skills I was fortunate enough to learn during the lockdown when COVID19 started.
    I love trading on the financial markets, trading allows me to generate moey from wherever I might be in the world as long as I have a stable network connection.
    <br>
    This is one of the skills that can be aquired from youtube but the best way to get a deeper understanding of how the market behaves is if you find yourself a reliable mentor who is willing to offer his time to you.
    <br>
    I have been asked several times by some people if I can mentor them
    I believe I do not have the necessary patience to walk with them on this tiring journey of trading. Trading is not a get rich quick scheme and if you approach the market with such a mentality you will end up giving up.

      <h3>Working out</h3>
    </li>
    We all know that working out is good for the body and mind. That is the reason why I love working out even though at times I find myself slacking.
    <br>
    I love lifting weights, performing bodyweight exercises and doing full body stretches so that my body does not become tight.
    <br>
    One of the benefits of exercising is the fact that it helps alleviate stress by releasing endorphins in the brain, that is one of the happy hormones all humans have.
    <br>
    I recommend exercising to everyone
